# Pycodejs

Pycodejs is a simple text filter designed to replace all div elements that have 
the pycode class to a fully interactive python editor.  All python code that exists
within the div will be placed within the editor pane.

### Quickstart

See python.html for a simple example - Just include python.js and python.css and you
are good to go.
